A homepage I had to code for a technical test. I had to replicate I design they sent me with certain specifications of CSS and behaviors to be done in JS.

I used a jQuery slider since I was not able to successfully create a working slider with pure CSS. I used some JavaScript to create the effect of changing color and the change of element size on the shopping items, since that was a requirement for the technical test. I also had to add such items through an array, which I have done in JS too.
